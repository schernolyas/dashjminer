Alright, I finally managed to fix my bugs and get a full roundtrip. Here is an example for a full communication with a Pool. I don't explain everything in detail as the API description can be found elsewhere.

a) Suscription

{"id": 1, "method": "mining.subscribe", "params": []}
{"error": null, "id": 1, "result": [["mining.notify", "ae6812eb4cd7735a302a8a9dd95cf71f"], "f8002c90", 4]}
We suscribe with the server. This has no parameters. As result, we receive some Suscription ID, and our Extranonce1 + extranonce2 size, which we need for later. b) authorization

{"params": ["User", "password"], "id": 2, "method": "mining.authorize"}
{"error": null, "id": 2, "result": true}
Authorize worker with Username + password. No parameters to store from the result. c) Server -> difficulty

{"params": [32], "id": null, "method": "mining.set_difficulty"}
Sets the difficulty to 32, defining our target. The resulting difficulty can be calculated as

0x0000FFFF00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 / 32 =
0x000007fff8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Now, the fun part:
d) Block info

{"params": ["b3ba", "7dcf1304b04e79024066cd9481aa464e2fe17966e19edf6f33970e1fe0b60277", "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff270362f401062f503253482f049b8f175308", 
"0d2f7374726174756d506f6f6c2f000000000100868591052100001976a91431482118f1d7504daf1c001cbfaf91ad580d176d88ac00000000", 
["57351e8569cb9d036187a79fd1844fd930c1309efcd16c46af9bb9713b6ee734", "936ab9c33420f187acae660fcdb07ffdffa081273674f0f41e6ecc1347451d23"],
"00000002", "1b44dfdb", "53178f9b", true], "id": null, "method": "mining.notify"}
I split the parameters and assign them to variables

job_id = "b3ba"
prevhash = "7dcf1304b04e79024066cd9481aa464e2fe17966e19edf6f33970e1fe0b60277"
coinb1 = "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff270362f401062f503253482f049b8f175308"
coinb2 = "0d2f7374726174756d506f6f6c2f000000000100868591052100001976a91431482118f1d7504daf1c001cbfaf91ad580d176d88ac00000000"
Merklebranches = [ 
    "57351e8569cb9d036187a79fd1844fd930c1309efcd16c46af9bb9713b6ee734", 
    "936ab9c33420f187acae660fcdb07ffdffa081273674f0f41e6ecc1347451d23"
    ]
version = "00000002"
nbits = "1b44dfdb"
ntime = "53178f9b"
clean_jobs = true// Not required for block, just for completeness
What we also need is extranonce1 and extranonce 2:

extranonce1 = "f8002c90" // from earlier
extranonce2 = "00000002" // can be anything, but 4 bytes
With this, we can start building our Merkle root: First, the coinbase:

coinbase = coinb1  + extranonce1 + extranonce2 + coinb2;
coinbase = "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff270362f401062f503253482f049b8f175308f8002c90000000020d2f7374726174756d506f6f6c2f000000000100868591052100001976a91431482118f1d7504daf1c001cbfaf91ad580d176d88ac00000000"
Now, we convert this coinbase into binary. No flips or BE-LE conversions required, straight from left to right. The resulting binary data is hashed with sha256(sha256(data)). From here on, I will post binary as hex representation, but as is: Left to right, no endianess conversion

resulting hash : 280b3927f6763b1ed90cae2a3cef4d27c743f6a7d91e3901dc3816a46acacf36
This is the start for the merkle concatination. Concatinating means just joining them. 32 byte for the hash and 32 byte for each merkleroot result in 64 byte of data to hash.

for each Merkle_branch
    byte[64] = hash + merkle_branch
    hash = sha256(sha256(byte))
end
For the example it looks like this:

byte = 280b3927f6763b1ed90cae2a3cef4d27c743f6a7d91e3901dc3816a46acacf36 + 
57351e8569cb9d036187a79fd1844fd930c1309efcd16c46af9bb9713b6ee734

hash = e6df228610b9f0e96a42a4877565627a3e1e133e984b6c46ff6e44b7dc9dc056

byte = e6df228610b9f0e96a42a4877565627a3e1e133e984b6c46ff6e44b7dc9dc056 + 936ab9c33420f187acae660fcdb07ffdffa081273674f0f41e6ecc1347451d23
hash = 0b1edc1ccf82d3214423fc68234f4946119e39df2cc2137e31ebc186191d5422
which is the final merkle_root. There is no need of converting it back to hex, it can be kept in binary format for the next step

e) Block header The block header is build with all previous information + the calculated merkle root. It results in 80 byte of Data

blockHeader {
    version[4]
    prevhash[32]
    merkle_root[32]
    ntime[4]
    nbit[4]
    nonce[4]
}
Here, byte order gets a bit tricky: All 4 byte types are Little endian, and bytes have to be flipped. Merkleroot can be copied 1:1, without flipping bytes. prevhash is what surprised me the most. It can be best viewed as an array of 8 4byte ints, where each of these ints has to be converted to LE, but the order is kept left to right. I show it in the example:

version:  00000002 --> 02000000
prevhash: 7dcf1304 b04e7902 4066cd94 81aa464e 2fe17966 e19edf6f 33970e1f e0b60277
        -->   0413cf7d 02794eb0 94cd6640 4e46aa81 6679e12f 6fdf9ee1 1f0e9733 7702b6e0 // 8 ints left to right, each one flipped
merkle:   0b1edc1c cf82d321 4423fc68 234f4946 119e39df 2cc2137e 31ebc186 191d5422 // nothing changed 
ntime:    53178f9b --> 9b8f1753
nbits:    1b44dfdb --> dbdf441b
Results in the following bytestream:

020000000413cf7d02794eb094cd66404e46aa816679e12f6fdf9ee11f0e97337702b6e00b1edc1ccf82d3214423fc68234f4946119e39df2cc2137e31ebc186191d54229b8f1753dbdf441b00000000
Note that we don't need the padding or anything, like the bitcoin implementations have, the 80 bytes are all we need. Now, lets hash it f) hashing and result sending this through a scrypt cycle results in the following hash:

f6f13e350aa4f251e192ab8a78690ee99f1cc2d930d4ae16c4172a0a8aefddd0
Well, this is not the hash we are looking for... So we start playing with nonce first, and if thats not enough we can increase the ntime. Until finally, after a long time, we try

nonce = "00007f8a" // BigEndian
time = "53178f9f" // BigEndian
This gives us the following Block and resulting hash:

block = 020000000413cf7d02794eb094cd66404e46aa816679e12f6fdf9ee11f0e97337702b6e00b1edc1ccf82d3214423fc68234f4946119e39df2cc2137e31ebc186191d54229f8f1753dbdf441b8a7f0000
hash = 7441207b6390054623bc5e659ffe2581356dafc5ec41db44d27de85035000000
Looks kind of high, but here again, endianess has to be considered. To compare it with our Target, we have to compare high to low. And, not to forget that we have to change the byte order of our target:

target = 0x000007fff8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   --->  0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f8ff070000
Now if we compare them:

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f8ff070000
7441207b6390054623bc5e659ffe2581356dafc5ec41db44d27de85035000000
We see that the hash is below our target, and we can submit it. Alternatively we can look at them in the other byte order (in which it is printed most of the time)

000007fff8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000003550e87dd244db41ecc5af6d358125fe9f655ebc23460590637b204174
Which looks the same, mostly. This leads us to our final step: g) Submit Share Now we collect the variable parameters we used, and send them to the server.

user = "user"
job_id = "b3ba"
extranonce2 = "00000002" // No byte swapping needed. Its how we put it in the coinbase
ntime = "53178f9f" // This is Big Endian. The ntime in the block_header is little endian. IF you read it from your block_header, don't forget to swap
nonce = "00007f8a" // Same here. Convert To BigEndian before sending
We pack these Data in a neat JSon wrapper, and send it off to the server:

{"params": ["User", "b3ba", "00000002", "53178f9f", "00007f8a"], "id": 4, "method": "mining.submit"}
And, if all works well, and we have no other problems (like stale shares or anything), we get a positive response:

{"error": null, "id": 4, "result": true}
And thats it! For more shares repeat as often as wanted.
